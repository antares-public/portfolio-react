      <p>Hi, my name is Maria.</p>

      <p>
        I am a Frontend Developer (TS, node, React) from Orenburg. Despite my
        main field of activity, I like low-level things.
      </p>

      <p>
        I participated in the development of a Sberclass constructor for an
        interactive educational game in Sberbank.
